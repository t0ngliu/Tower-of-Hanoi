# Tower of Hanoi - Pokemon Edition
Tower of Hanoi. This was one of my grade 12 computer science course projects. The instructions were to make a Tower of Hanoi simulation. We were allowed to use any tool, I chose to use C++ and Allegro 4 for the GUI. I decided to make this a Pokemon themed Tower of Hanoi, frankly because I thought it was an awesome idea!

The user chooses the number of disks they want to simulate ([1,8]) and the program will demonstrate how many moves it will take to solve. The user can also choose the speed of the simulation - slow, medium and fast.
